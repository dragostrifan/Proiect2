                    Three more hours of this steady pace will bring us to the first campsite in Upis.
                    You have the option to take a dip in the hot springs in Upis if you bring a swimsuit!<br>

                    We'll spend a little time here to celebrate our accomplishment before rewarding our legs and lungs with a descent to our next campsite.
                    We will reach camp at Puka Qocha where the chef will be waiting with Andean happy hour and dinner.<br>

                    Just when you think it can't get more beautiful, we'll start to descend for 2 hours and find our first views of the famous rainbow mountains until we get to lunch.
                    With a full stomach, we'll hike for another 1.5 hours to the 3rd and final mountain pass - Warmisaya (14,370ft).  We can spend as much time as we want here before hiking the last 30 minutes to our campsite.*

                    We'll climb through the cloudy forest on a trail and a maze of stone steps and Inca ruins until we reach the Inca site of Wiñay Wayna (Forevery Young).  This is a tough day, but we'll be with you for every step and it will feel amazing at the end.
                    From Wiñay Wayna, we will have a bite to eat and walk on an easy path to the entrance of Machu Picchu - the Sun Gate.
                    After celebrating this incredible accomplishment, we'll hike down into Machu Picchu city for a quick look around before heading to Aguas Calientes and another nice hotel for the evening.<br>

                    You have the option to add a Huayna Picchu climb or Machu Picchu mountain climb (if you book tickets in advance!) if you want to do something extra within the city.
